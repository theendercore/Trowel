# Trowel
This mod is a simple port of the Quark mods Trowel item. Its been written from scratch by me. I just borrowed the original idea from Quark.

## Dependencies
This mod Depends on [Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin)
*(I'm sorry for dependency)*

## Features 
When right clicked it picks a random block from your hotbar and places is down. *(For a visual demonstration go to the images tab)* </br>To craft the trowel you need 1 stick and 2 ingots. 


*PS. Thanks Astra for icon art*

Thank you unroman for Ukrainian translation!
